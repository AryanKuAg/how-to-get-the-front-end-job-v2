# My Notes
[.] Avoid writing as 'full stack developers' cause full stack needs a lot of things like here u can see the learning path of full stack -> https://frontendmasters.com/learn/fullstack/ and if you know these stuff then consider yourself as a full stack developer
[.] First Be best at one thing, say, Front end then raise your tech stack.. Follow 3 am rule, like if someone wakes u up at 3 am and told to fix something then u can.
[.] You wanna focus on your strengths and be able to use that as your biggest selling point. If you put a bunch of stuff in your resume that you're not strong on, then somebody will ask questions that you're not prepared for.
[.] Before applying see the company in linkedin and research about it and see whether anyone is in your network has connection with their employees and ask them for more details about the interview and if possible then referral.
