# My Notes
[.] Avoid writing as 'full stack developers' cause full stack needs a lot of things like here u can see the learning path of full stack -> https://frontendmasters.com/learn/fullstack/ and if you know these stuff then consider yourself as a full stack developer
[.] First Be best at one thing, say, Front end then raise your tech stack.. Follow 3 am rule, like if someone wakes u up at 3 am and told to fix something then u can.
